Theoretical Foundation Governing Equations of Motion Projectile motion follows Newton\u2019s second law and is influenced by gravity. Assuming no air resistance, the motion can be decomposed into: Horizontal motion (constant velocity): [ x(t) = v_0 \\cos(\\theta) t ] Vertical motion (accelerated motion under gravity): [ y(t) = v_0 \\sin(\\theta) t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2 ] where: - \\( v_0 \\) is the initial velocity, - \\( \\theta \\) is the launch angle, - \\( g \\) is gravitational acceleration ( \\(9.81 \\text{ m/s}^2\\) on Earth), - \\( t \\) is time. The projectile reaches the ground when \\( y(t) = 0 \\) , solving for \\( t \\) : \\[ t = \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin(\\theta)}{g} \\] Substituting this into \\( x(t) \\) , the range \\( R \\) is: \\[ R = \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin(2\\theta)}{g} \\] Effects of Initial Conditions The maximum range occurs at \\( \\theta = 45^\\circ \\) .

Analysis of the Range The function \\( R = f(\\theta) \\) follows a symmetric curve with a peak at \\( 45^\\circ \\) . Doubling \\( v_0 \\) increases \\( R \\) by a factor of 4.
