# Problem 1
# **Problem 1: Interference Patterns on a Water Surface**  

---

## **1. Introduction**  

Interference is a fundamental wave phenomenon that occurs when two or more waves overlap. On a water surface, ripples from multiple sources interact, creating patterns of constructive and destructive interference.  

This problem explores **wave interference from multiple point sources**, arranged at the vertices of a **regular polygon**. The goal is to visualize and understand how the superposition of waves results in complex patterns.  

---

## **2. Theoretical Background**  

### **Single Wave Equation**  

A circular wave propagating from a single point source located at \(\mathbf{r}_i\) is given by:

\[
y_i(\mathbf{r}, t) = A \cos(k d_i - \omega t + \phi)
\]

where:  
- \( A \) = amplitude of the wave,  
- \( k = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda} \) = wave number (related to wavelength \( \lambda \)),  
- \( \omega = 2\pi f \) = angular frequency (related to frequency \( f \)),  
- \( d_i = |\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}_i| \) = distance from source \( i \) to point \( \mathbf{r} \),  
- \( \phi \) = initial phase of the wave.  

---

### **Superposition of Multiple Waves**  

If there are \( N \) sources, each emitting a wave, the total displacement at a point \( \mathbf{r} \) is:

\[
y(\mathbf{r}, t) = \sum_{i=1}^{N} A \cos(k d_i - \omega t + \phi)
\]

This sum determines the **interference pattern** on the water surface.  

- **Constructive Interference**: Occurs when waves add up (\( \Delta \phi = 0, 2\pi, 4\pi, ... \)).  
- **Destructive Interference**: Occurs when waves cancel out (\( \Delta \phi = \pi, 3\pi, 5\pi, ... \)).  

By positioning sources at **regular polygon vertices**, we observe **symmetrical patterns** that depend on the number of sources.

## **3. Computational Simulation**  

We will:  
- Choose a **regular polygon** (e.g., equilateral triangle, square, pentagon).  
- Generate waves from **each vertex** using the superposition principle.  
- Visualize **constructive and destructive interference** with color maps.

## **4. Analysis of Interference Patterns**  

### **1. Triangle (\(N = 3\))**  
- Forms a **sixfold symmetric pattern** with alternating bright and dark regions.  
- Strong central interference due to wave overlap.  

### **2. Square (\(N = 4\))**  
- Produces a **checkerboard-like interference pattern** with symmetry along diagonals.  
- Alternating constructive/destructive zones between sources.  

### **3. Pentagon (\(N = 5\))**  
- Creates a more **intricate star-like pattern** due to additional wave interactions.  
- Shows radial symmetry with high interference at center.
